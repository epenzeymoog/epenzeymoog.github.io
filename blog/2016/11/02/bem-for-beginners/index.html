<p>Having a naming methodology is important for scalability, reusability and readability. A while ago I studied up on three of the most popular conventions: OOCSS, SMACSS, and BEM. I felt that the first two left too much up to the personal style of the person writing the code, and as a young developer, I didn’t have much confidence that they would work for me, as I don't have years of experience experimenting and trying different naming styles to draw upon. BEM, on the other hand, appealed to me because it is both simple and strict. There are only three types of styles, and figuring out the correct option is very straight-forward. After a few months of adhering to the BEM philosophy, I have come to love how simple and maintainable it makes my CSS. I believe that BEM is the perfect method for other front-end beginners.</p>

<p>BEM touts itself as being a good practice for large projects, especially when working with a team and when creating a site that will be maintained by others later, but it also works well for small or individual projects. BEM is immediately recognizable, making maintainability easier than some of the other options, which often require a developer to sift through new code for a while to figure out the naming conventions.</p>

<p>BEM stands for Block, Element, and Modifier. Websites can be broken down into meaningful blocks, which are made up of their elements. Modifiers are used to manipulate their states.</p>

<p><strong>Blocks</strong></p>
<p>Blocks are chunks that can stand alone  and are meaningful by themselves, such as headers, footers and sidebars. Each block contains its own set of elements. For example, let’s take a navigation bar that has a few links to different pages. To create a block we would simply give it a class name:</p>

<p><code>nav</code></p>

<p>Block syntax only allows for a single dash, meaning that if we had two different navigations and were doing all of this twice, we would make two blocks: one called <code>main-nav</code> and one called <code>secondary-nav</code>. So far this is just a regular class - it doesn’t really become BEM until we fill up this block with elements.</p>

<p><strong>Elements</strong></p>
<p>Elements, unlike blocks, don’t have meaning on their own. They are semantically tied to their blocks. To better understand this, let’s go back to the example of a navigation bar. The various links inside of them are elements - let’s say they’re links to pages for “About,” “Team,” and “Blog.” If we saw those words on a page alone, they wouldn’t mean much to us. But once we stick them in their <code>nav</code> block, with its elements side-by-side at the top of the page, we understand that they are links in a navigation. Each of the links in our navigation are an element and would get the class name:</p>

<p><code>nav__item</code></p>

<p>If there was something else in the navigation, like a logo icon, we would name it similarly:</p>

<p><code>nav__icon</code></p>

<p>Elements are always written by first using the name for the block it lives inside, followed by a double underscore and then the name of the element. Remember that BEM helps us make our classes modular, so you want to leave your names vague enough that the styles can be reused elsewhere but not so vague that you have no idea what’s going on. After all, another point of BEM is to be able to quickly figure out what’s going on. For example, I chose the name <code>nav__icon</code> rather than <code>nav__logo</code> because while the icon I add may be the company logo now, what if for some reason we swap it out for something else, like a pumpkin to celebrate Hallowe’en? Then it’s just an icon, and the word “logo” doesn’t fit. That’s a silly example, but the need to have flexible, reusable styles is very real, even with small projects.</p>

<p>This is a good time to mention that finding the perfect name for classes when writing HTML and CSS can be extremely difficult. When I was first trying to adhere to BEM naming, I used to sit at my laptop for long moments at a time, staring off into space trying to come up with the right name. I've since learned that it's better to not waste too much time trying to find the perfect name, since I usually end up changing it later on. Sometimes the perfect names are only clear in the context of the whole project, and are easy to figure out during a round of refactoring. All in all, you should struggle a bit with coming up with names, but don't let it derail you from the work at hand. Just make sure that you're refactoring later on - this is often when the perfect name becomes suddenly obvious.</p>

<p>The conventions may look a little strange, but it’s worth it to know quickly which category a class falls into. When you follow BEM naming, you’ll immediately understand that a class name like <code>form-table</code> is a block, while <code>form-table__button</code> is an element within that block.</p>

<p><strong>Modifiers</strong></p>
<p>Modifiers do just what you’d think they do - they modify a block or element when you need to make just a slight change. For example:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/epenzeymoog/7b0c89ab927bb5818906057a73b227ce.js"></script>

<p>The fourth line has the name of the element followed by two dashes and the word “current” to show that this is the current page. This is how BEM tells us to write modifiers It may get an additional style or two, but is otherwise the same as the other <code>nav__item</code> elements.</p>

<p><strong>BEM for CSS</strong></p>
<p>A common critique of BEM is that it bloats your HTML, and I have to admit that this is somewhat true. However, the clarity gained from this kind of naming is well worth it. Additionally, BEM helps us get away from nesting our CSS styles, which ultimately makes things much easier to change later, and allows us to reuse our styles.</p>

<p>Before I learned BEM, I might have styles my navigation like so:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/epenzeymoog/3e26b11233b389881cfd126187faa52e.js"></script>

<p>This was ok, but what if I want to reuse the styles I applied to my navigation links to my footer, only I want to give them a different color? I’d have to either figure out how to override the previous styles or write it out all over again. Nesting is not allowed with BEM, as nesting makes it difficult to reuse styles. The BEM way makes it much easier to reuse styles. Here’s how I would write my BEM CSS:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/epenzeymoog/cd1bdaad1eabfb83c8676733018200a4.js"></script>

<p>No nesting, no hassle later on when I want to reuse a style. I have the option to give all my footer links the same <code>.nav__link</code> styles without having to use the <code>.nav__item</code> styles. BEM's disallowance of dependencies makes it extremely reusable.</p>

<p><strong>BEM for New Developers</strong></p>
<p>As someone who’s still on the newer end of writing code for the front-end, I find BEM’s simplicity and strictness appealing. When you’re still getting your bearings on how things work, anything that will make it easier to understand what’s going on is a necessity, and BEM does just that. It feels strange to write code with its rules at first, but it quickly becomes second nature, and you’ll thank yourself the first time you have to make a change to a project you haven’t touched for a few months are are able to quickly find what you’re looking for. At the end of the day, there are lots of options out there, and it’s most important that you find one that suits the needs of you and your team. But if you’re just starting out and looking for a naming methodology that will bring some structure to chaotic code, BEM is a great option.</p>
