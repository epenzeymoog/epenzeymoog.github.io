			<h1 class="title">Eva PenzeyMoog</h1>
			<p>I'm the founder of <a href="https://www.inclusivesafety.com/">The Inclusive Safety Project</a> and a principle designer at <a href="http://www.8thlight.com" target="_blank">8th Light</a>, where I design and build custom software and consult on safe and inclusive design strategy.</p>
			<p>I work to ensure that digital products cannot be used as tools for abuse, with the goal of reducing harm in the world through centering the safety of victims of domestic violence.</p>
			<p>My design philosophy is to ground my decisions in research and testing, take "edge cases" seriously, and create products that solve real problems rather than creating new ones. I also love design-focused code, and my ideal project is one that ends with me bringing my designs to life in the browser with HTML and SCSS.</p>

			<h3 class="header">Designing Against Domestic Violence</h3>
			<p>I work to ensure that digital products cannot be be used as tools of abuse, and share my findings with other people who create digital products. This work involves research of how technology both enables abuse and fails to recognize user behavior that indicates abuse, resulting in a lost opportunity to offer meaningful support. I'm intentional about providing clear, true (and always anonymous) examples, and aim to provide a concrete set of steps that  people who work in tech can take to build products that won't result in harm against their users.</p>
			<p>My talk, Designing Against Domestic Violence, is the culmination of this research and the first step of a larger project to reduce harm in the world through centering the safety of victims of domestic violence. I call this work "designing for inclusive safety." If you want to support me in this work, please visit my <a href="https://www.patreon.com/epenzeymoog">Patreon page.</a></p>
			<p class="link-secondary">I'm currently taking inquiries for <em>remote</em> talks and workshops. If you're interested in me presenting remotely at your conference or workplace, please <a href="mailto:penzeymoog@gmail.com">reach out</a>.</p>

				<p>The pandemic caused the conferences I was scheduled to speak at in 2020 to be canceled, and I'm not sure when I'll be speaking again. In the meantime, you can view a recording of my talk <a href="https://vimeo.com/373462514" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
			</ul></p>

			<p>I have a lot of thoughts about the role of individual designers and developers in fixing unethical tech versus the need for regulation. I'm very interested in working on the issues of technology-facilitated domestic violence from a policy level.

			<h3 class="header">Teaching & Mentoring</h3>
			<p>I worked in education non-profit before making a change to the tech world. I love teaching and mentoring other career changers and helping them find their way into the fields of design and development. I teach on and off through General Assembly and do frequent informal instruction and mentoring.</p>
			<p class="link-secondary">I'm currently taking a break from my normal offer to do half hour calls with people new to design. I hope to be able to start these up again soon; please check back in a few months.</p>
