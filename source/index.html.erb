	  	<h1 class="title">Eva PenzeyMoog, Lead Designer</h1>
	    	<p>At <a href="http://www.8thlight.com" target="_blank">8th Light</a>, I work with a variety of companies to take their products through the full design process, from discovery to implementation in the browser, overseeing the full process of a its creation. As a Lead Designer, I specialize in UX and use my skills as a front-end engineer to ensure that every piece of the design is intuitive and simple.</p>
	    	<p> Over all else, I aim to create products that are useful, safe, and honor people’s limited resources (especially the resource of time). My design philosophy is to approach each step of the process and new challenge with a mixture of design experience and authentic research. I take research seriously, and believe our design solutions must work for people regardless of ability; I don’t believe in edge cases. </p>

			<h3 class="header">Inclusive Safety</h3>
			<p>I work to ensure that digital products cannot be be used as tools of abuse, and share my findings with other people who create digital products. My goal is to reduce harm in the world through centering the safety of victims of domestic violence. I call this work "designing for inclusive safety."</p>
			<p>My talk, Designing Against Domestic Violence, covers these topics as well as how designers and others in the tech space can start to do this work within in their current products and spheres of influence. If you’re interested in this talk appearing at your conference, workplace, or other setting, please reach out.</p>

			<h3 class="header">Teaching & Mentoring</h3>
			<p>I worked in education non-profit before making a change to the tech world. I love teaching and mentoring other career changers and helping them find their way into the fields of design and development. I teach on and off through General Assembly and do frequent informal instruction and mentoring.</p>
			<p>If you’re from a group that is underrepresented in tech and need some guidance on breaking into the field, reach out and I will try to help.</p>

			<h3 class="header">Elsewhere in the World</h3>
			<p>I spend my non-design time consuming any zombie-related media I can get my hands on, creating cyanotype prints, and hanging out with my dogs, Hamlet and Horatio.</p>

			<p>Cyanotypes are one-of-a-kind cyan-blue prints that result from a historical process that blends photography and printmaking. My prints feature botanicals and fabrics from meaningful spaces and events. I sell the best ones on <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/EvaPenzeyMoog" target="_blank">Etsy.</a></p>
			<p>Cute pictures of Hamlet and Horatio are online <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hamletandhoratio/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
