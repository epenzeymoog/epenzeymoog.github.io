        <p>I'm currently booking speaking and workshop engagements for 2021. If you want to learn how to prevent your tech from being weaponized for harm and practice designing for safety, I’d love to speak or lead a workshop at your event. Contact me about your speaking at your conference, in-house event, or workshop by emailing penzeymoog at gmail dot com.</p>

            <p class="bold">Justice, Safety, Compassion: Shifting the Ethical Tech Paradigm</p>
            <p>What do we actually mean when we talk about making the tech - both the products and the industry - more ethical? This talk explores the necessary changes in terms of safety, justice, and compassion and how to contribute to changing the tech paradigm.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p class="bold">Designing Against Domestic Violence</p>
            <p>The reality of domestic violence doesn’t disappear when people enter the digital world. Abusers use technology to exploit and control their victims, meaning we have a responsibility to ensure user safety. How can we prevent people with violent intentions from using our digital products as tools of abuse? This talk helps the audience understand the intersections of technology and domestic violence and provide a framework for designing against domestic violence.</p>
