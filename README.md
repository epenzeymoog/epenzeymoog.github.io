# epenzeymoog.github.io
My portfolio site built on Middleman

To start the server: middleman serve

Only ever work in the source directory.

To deploy the site:
stay on branch `source` and then run: 
middleman build
middleman deploy

After a deploy, if site appears to be down, check:
Settings > Custom domain
and make sure that evapenzeymoog.com is there.
